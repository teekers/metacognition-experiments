Initial notes:

Melissa's project

"Directed forgetting"

Sequence:
- Instructions
- "Remember these words" | [show List 1]
- "That was practice, remember these words instead"
- [show List 2]
- Distractor task
- Judgements: 
-- "How likely are you to forget the items from the practice list?" 0->100
-- "How many items will you forget from the practice list?"
- Test- fragment completion (2 letters) for both lists

Conditions: 
1. Control group- no judgement
2. vary # items on list 2 (less, same, more than list 1)
3. difference in word lists, semantic interferece (category match, mismatch)

Data:
• what they saw
• judgements
• recall errors (what they chose, which list it really came from)
• subject number
 
 
 Questions:
 - Order same/different between presentation and test?
 -
