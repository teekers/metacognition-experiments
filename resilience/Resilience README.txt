INSTRUCTION TEXT
***************************
You will be asked a series of trivia questions, one at a time.

First you will see a question. When you are ready to answer, click the “ready to answer” button and then type your answer. If you do not know the answer, leave it blank.

All answers must be ONE word. If the answer is a number, type the actual number (3, NOT three).

Once you have answered, select the button (1-10) that best corresponds to your confidence in your answer. “1” indicates that you are completely unsure and do not know if you are right and “10” indicates that you are completely confident in your answer and think you are right. 

For example: 
1) What are the team colors for the New York Mets? Orange and  _______. 
Click “ready to answer”
You type in “blue”
Then, you click your confidence button, such as “8” if you are pretty confident the answer is “blue,” but are not 100% sure.

2) Who was the 35th President of the United States?
Click “ready to answer”
If you have no idea and cannot guess, leave it blank.
Then, you click your confidence button. If you are 100% confident that you do not know this answer, click 10.

REMINDER: All answers must be ONE word or number. No spaces in your answers. 

Questions before we start activity:
On a scale of 1-10,
How are you feeling today?
How excited are you to do this activity?

DATA FILE DOCUMENTATION:
***************************

Full Data Summary:
Response = what participant typed in
Strict Accuracy = exact match for right answer and what participant wrote (0 or 1)
Lenient Accuracy = takes into account typos
Score = 70 or above ~ correct lenient accuracy
Calculated based on letter by letter
Note: numerical answers seen as strings of text: so 10 and 160 would be seen as correct in lenient accuracy because of “1” and “0” even though wrong answer
Answer RT: measuring time between when question is visible and when they push the button that they are ready to answer. Hitting the button stops the timer.
Confidence = number they selected
Confidence RT = time between when they hit ready to answer to when they make their confidence judgment. Time to type and time to make the judgment 
Self Assessment = in blocks of self assessment (said think they got 5 right out of time- example)
SelfA_Prop = Self Assessment/SelfA_Total

Summary File:
Confidence Level = gave confidence level of 1-10, chosen number of times. 
Correct = hw many times that confidence level was chosen correctly
Proportion correct = correct/chosen – proportion of how many they got correct at the confidence level they estimated
Self Assessments
After every 10 questions 
Assessed correct: how many you thought you got correct
Actual Correct: how many they did get correct
Assessed Proportion correct vs. Actual Proportions are columns of significance
